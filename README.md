# Capstone-Project
This app started out as project Capstone for Udacity's Android developer nano degree. I will actively make updates to the project until I find an idea for another app.

# Running the app
* Create a new firebase project from the firebase console.
* Create an Android app on the firebase console and download the google-services.json file
* Copy the google-services.json file inside the app folder in android studio.
